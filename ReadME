## About Our Group Project: SchedualMeualMe

We're building SchedualMeualMeâ€”a Simple Task/To-Do List Manager that highlights essential programming skills.  
**Features:**  
- Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete  
- Organize tasks into categories  
- Potential for extra features like due dates and custom views

**Audience:**  
SchedualMeualMe is designed for anyone needing to track daily activities, from students to professionals.

**Why This Project Works:**  
Development can be staged, starting with basic CRUD operations and expanding to more advanced features. This approach makes it manageable for solo or team development and allows for continuous improvement.
