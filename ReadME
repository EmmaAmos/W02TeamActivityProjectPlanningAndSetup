## About Our Group Project: SchedualMe

We're building SchedualMeâ€”a Simple Task/To-Do List Manager that highlights essential programming skills.  
**Features:**  
- Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete  
- Organize tasks into categories  
- Potential for extra features like due dates and custom views

**Audience:**  
SchedualMe is designed for anyone needing to track daily activities, from students to professionals.

**Why This Project Works:**  
Development can be staged, starting with basic CRUD operations and expanding to more advanced features. This approach makes it manageable for solo or team development and allows for continuous improvement.

    ## Meeting Summary

    Emma Amos: Due to a lack of response from other group members, I completed the initial brainstorming and project setup tasks independently. This included outlining the project goals, defining key features, and organizing the repository structure. All planning and setup work for this phase was performed by me.
